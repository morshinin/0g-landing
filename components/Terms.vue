      <p>PLEASE READ THIS INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY</p>
      <p>
        This document represents an agreement between you (“You” or the “User”)
        and “0g” game with its subsidiaries, affiliates and
        agencies ( “Game” or “Service”), hereinafter collectively referred to as
        the “Parties” and individually as a “Party”.
      </p>
      <p>
        BY SIGNING IN SERVICE YOU HEREBY CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OLD AND
        UNDER NO RESTRICTIONS TO USE THIS WEBSITE AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GAME
        OR CONDUCT ANY OPERATIONS WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY UNDER THE APPLECABLE LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is a software product, a distributed application (dApp) to be
        developed and launched on the Ethereum network as described in the
        “White Book” document.
      </p>
      <p>
        “0g” development has not yet been completed and will
        require significant capital funding, expertise, time and effort of the
        management team in order to successfully launch the game. Changes may be
        made to the specifications of the MegaCyptoPolis product described in
        the “White Book”.
      </p>
      <p>Participation in the game involves a high degree of risk.</p>
      <p>
        You should accept and acknowledge each of the following points described
        below, together with all of the other information contained on the
        official 0g website before making a decision to
        participate.
      </p>
      <p>NOT AN INVESTMENT</p>
      <p>
        Service and it’s Tokens are not an investment, currency, security,
        commodity, a swap on a currency, security or commodity or any other kind
        of financial instrument. You should not participate in the Game or
        acquire Tokens for investment purposes. Game is not designed for
        investment purposes, speculation, as some type of arbitrage strategy,
        for immediate resale or other financial purposes.
      </p>
      <p>NO RIGHTS CREATED</p>
      <p>
        Participation in the Service does not provide you with rights of any
        form with respect to the Game or its revenues or assets, including, but
        not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation,
        proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other
        financial or legal rights. Participation in the Service does not
        represent a loan to Game and does not provide you with any ownership or
        other interest in the Game.
      </p>
      <p>THE PRODUCT MAY NOT BE LAUNCHED</p>
      <p>
        The game may not be successfully developed, marketed and/or launched.
        Users may not receive tokens, any product or service. It is possible
        that the 0g game and assets may not ever be released. There
        may never be an operational token and the game launch may not occur.
      </p>
      <p>CHANGES COULD BE MADE</p>
      <p>
        0g developers may have to make changes to the
        specifications of the game. Developers may be unable to deliver
        0g in a way that reflects the specifications or any form of
        functioning as described in this document.
      </p>
      <p>FAILURE TO MAINTAIN</p>
      <p>
        It is still possible that the game will experience malfunctions or
        otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may
        negatively impact the 0g and game assets.
      </p>
      <p>CEASE OF OPERATIONS</p>
      <p>
        It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not
        limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic
        currencies, or in the case of 0g, may not be widely adopted
        and may have limited users, or alternative products may be established
        that compete with or, are will be more widely used. The developers may
        no longer be viable to operate and the 0g platform, with
        all of its game assets, may dissolve or cease to exist.
      </p>
      <p>HIGH VOLATILITY</p>
      <p>
        The prices of the Ethereum cryptocurrency and any game assets may be
        extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of crypto tokens could
        materially and adversely affect the value of your digital assets.
      </p>
      <p>BUGS &amp; THREATS</p>
      <p>
        0g may be the target of malicious cyberattacks or contain
        exploitable flaws in its underlying code, which may result in security
        breaches and the loss or theft of game assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the 0g’s security is compromised, or if the
        0g is subject to attacks that frustrate our Users’ ability
        to access the 0g, their game assets or the 0g
        product and services, players may cut back or stop using the
        0g platform, which could seriously curtail the game process
        and the value of game assets.
      </p>
      <p>TAXES</p>
      <p>
        The tax treatment about cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain and
        there may be adverse tax consequences for Users upon certain future
        events.
      </p>
      <p>REGULATORY RISKS</p>
      <p>
        The regulatory regime governing the blоckсhain technologies,
        cryptocurrencies, tokens and distributed networks is uncertain, new
        regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development
        of 0g and the value of game assets.
      </p>
      <p>LOSS OF CONTROL</p>
      <p>
        Due to its distributed nature, the 0g’ developers may have
        no control or may only have limited control of the product once the game
        has launched.
      </p>
      <p>BLОCKСHAIN RELATED RISKS</p>
      <p>
        Upgrades that are directly involved within the Ethereum network (hard
        fork or further platform developments) may change the way transactions
        are confirmed and how game assets and tokens are used.
      </p>
      <p>LOSS OF FUNDS</p>
      <p>
        Users may be subject to lose all of their Ether cryptocurrency that is
        transferred to 0g smart contracts.
      </p>
